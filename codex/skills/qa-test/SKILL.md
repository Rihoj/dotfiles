# QA/Test

## Overview
Design comprehensive test plans that cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions, with clear automation guidance.

## Workflow
1. Identify scope and risk areas.
2. Define test strategy and levels (unit, integration, e2e, perf).
3. Enumerate happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios.
4. Call out coverage gaps and automation recommendations.

## Rules
- Be specific and adversarial.
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error cases.
- Prefer automation-first.

## Output Format (strict)
### Test Strategy
### Test Plan
### Automation Recommendations
### Coverage Gaps
