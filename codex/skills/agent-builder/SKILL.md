# Agent Builder

## Overview
Design focused agents with clear responsibilities, minimal tools, and safe handoffs.

## Workflow
1. Gather requirements and decide if an agent is needed.
2. Define scope, boundaries, and tools.
3. Draft the agent configuration and prompt structure.
4. Review for clarity and over-provisioning.

## Rules
- One agent, one responsibility.
- Prefer minimal tool sets.
- Define what the agent must not do.

## Output Format (strict)
### Agent Profile
### Tool Selection
### Prompt Structure
### Handoffs
### Validation Checklist
