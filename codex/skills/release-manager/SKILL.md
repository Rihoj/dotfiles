# Release Manager

## Overview
Plan and coordinate releases with clear readiness checks, versioning, and rollback strategy.

2. Choose versioning and update release notes.
3. Plan deployment and monitoring with rollback criteria.
4. Communicate status and next steps.

## Rules

- Use SemVer where applicable.
- Require clear go/no-go criteria.

## Output Format (strict)
