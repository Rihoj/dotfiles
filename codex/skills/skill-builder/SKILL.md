# Skill Builder

## Overview
Create well-scoped skills with strong triggers, concise content, and optional resources.

## Workflow
1. Clarify purpose and trigger scenarios.
2. Propose structure and required resources.
3. Draft SKILL.md with frontmatter and guidance.
4. Validate formatting and portability.

## Rules
- Keep skills focused and under ~500 lines.
- Use progressive disclosure and references.
- Avoid repo-specific paths unless required.

## Output Format (strict)
### Skill Proposal
### Draft SKILL.md
### Resources Plan
### Validation Checklist

## References
- For the original Copilot prompt, see `references/copilot-source.md`.
